# BPS Voltage Temperature Minion PCB

## Purpose
This board communicates with the [Leader Board](https://github.com/lhr-solar/BPS-LeaderPCB) over ISOSPI. It is capable of reading up to 12 voltage measurements and 16 temperature measurements. It is also capable of implementing battery balancing through the LTC6811.

## Connectors
* Two 10 pin headers that are used to place the [Minion Hat Board](https://github.com/lhr-solar/BPS-MinionShieldPCB) on top
* Two 7 pin connectors that are used to connect the voltage taps to the board
* Two 2 pin connectors for ISOSPI communication

## BOM
[Mouser cart](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=1d4073bff4) of all the components that cannot be sampled.
